# Hangman
First version of a game "Hangman" written in JS and React. I did it in my free time, in just two hours, so it may not be ideal, but it's only a test. I want to do better version with additional functionalities in the future.

Source files:
App.js - main source file of the app;
App.css - CSS sheet, thanks to whick game looks acceptable;
mysteries.js - it contains an array of entries and their categories - I know that there are only few, but I didn't have time to deploy more

You can test the game - enter https://awojciak.github.io/Hangman/
